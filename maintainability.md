Maintainability - Damian Gostomski
==================================

This is an outline of the topics I will cover in this chaper. It's by no means a complete list (yet):

* Definition of maintainable code
* Why this isn't covered at uni
	* Lots of small focused tasks instead of an evolving project - No need to maintain previous code
* My first experience of having to maintain code
	* How not knowing this stuff affected me
* Focus on _now_ vs focus on the _future_
	* No matter what you think you will have to maintain code at some point (yours or someone elses)
* Benefits of maintainable code
* Warning signs of unmaintainable code
	* Duplication
	* Excessively long methods / classes
	* Vague class / method / variable names
	*
* Tips for maintainable code
	* Write code for people, not machines
	* Separation of concerns (and small, well defined functions as a side effect)
	* Documentation (inline comments, API docs, architecturalsp notes etc)
	* Automated tests
	* Meaningful method names
	* Plan for change
	* Coding standards
* If it's too late, test and refactor
